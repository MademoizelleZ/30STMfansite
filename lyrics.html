                    <p>Where does your garden grow?
                    Tell me the secrets that you know
                    Another time, another place
                    Where are the holy ones?
                    Selling the secret to the sun
                    Welcome to the Universe
                    Cross the line
                    Redefine
                    Lose your mind

                    What've you got?
                    Doesn't matter to me 'cause I don't want them
                    I'm not the only one</p>

                    <p>The unified divide
                    Among and then deny
                    Now could you kindly cut to the chase?
                    It's like some other song
                    Pretty but something's always wrong
                    Show me the secret ancient sign</p>

                    <p>What if I wanted to break
                    Laugh it all off in your face
                    What would you do? (Oh, oh)
                    What if I fell to the floor
                    Couldn't take all this anymore
                    What would you do, do, do?</p>

                    <p>Come break me down
                    Bury me, bury me
                    I am finished with you</p>

                    <p>What if I wanted to fight
                    Beg for the rest of my life
                    What would you do?
                    You say you wanted more
                    What are you waiting for?
                    I'm not running from you (from you)</p>

                    <p>Come break me down
                    Bury me, bury me
                    I am finished with you
                    Look in my eyes
                    You're killing me, killing me
                    All I wanted was you</p>

                    <p>I tried to be someone else
                    But nothing seemed to change
                    I know now, this is who I really am inside.
                    Finally found myself
                    Fighting for a chance.
                    I know now, this is who I really am.</p>

                    I am finished with you, you, you.
                    Look in my eyes
                    You're killing me, killing me

                    <p>I don't remember the moment I tried to forget
                    I lost myself, is it better not said
                    Now I'm closer to the edge</p>

                    <p>It was a thousand to one and a million to two
                    Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
                    Closer to the edge</p>

                    <p>[Chorus:]
                    No I'm not saying I'm sorry
                    One day maybe we'll meet again
                    No I'm not saying I'm sorry
                    One day maybe we'll meet again
                    No no no no</p>

                    <p>(Can you, can you, can you)
                    Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free?
                    The birth of a song, the death of a dream
                    Closer to the edge</p>

                    <p>This never ending story
                    Paid for with pride and fate
                    We all fall short of glory
                    Lost in our fate</p>

                    <p>[Chorus]</p>

                    <p>[2x]
                    No no no no
                    I will never forget
                    No no
                    I will never regret
                    No no
                    I will live my life</p>

                    <p>[Chorus]</p>

                    <p>Closer to the edge
                    Closer to the edge
                    No no no no
                    Closer to the edge
                    Closer to the edge
                    No no no no
                    Closer to the edge

                    <p>There was truth
                    There was consequence
                    Against you, a weak defense
                    Then there's me, I'm seventeen
                    Looking for a fight</p>

                    <p>All my life I was never there
                    Just a ghost running scared
                    Here our dreams aren't made–
                    They're won.</p>

                    <p>Lost in the city of angels
                    Down in the comfort of strangers
                    I found myself in the fire burned hills
                    In the land of a billion lights</p>

                    <p>Bought my fate straight from hell
                    Second sight has paid off well
                    For a mother, a brother and me</p>

                    <p>The silver of a lake at night
                    The hills of Hollywood on fire
                    A boulevard of hope and dreams
                    Streets made of desire</p>
